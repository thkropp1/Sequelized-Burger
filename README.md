# Sequelized-Burger
Sequelized-Burger: Taking the Eat-Da-Burger app and sequelizing it.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Chomp Da Burger! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
